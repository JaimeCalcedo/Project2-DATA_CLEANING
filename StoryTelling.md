## INTRODUCTION ##

Sharks are at the top of the food chain. The ocean predators follow their instincts. The good news is that humans are not on their diet list. However, like us, they make mistakes, too.

## HYPOTHESIS ##

The vast majority of shark incidents are mistakes, they assume something we are not. To a shark, a surfer paddling on a surfboard can look a lot like its typical prey.

Considering surfers rarely provoke a shark on the water, like maybe scuba divers or swimmers ocasionally do. And the fact that this mistakes sharks make, are statiscally more probable to occur with surfers than with other humans doing other activities that don´t look so alike shark´s usual prey. I think is reasonable to make the follow hypothesis:

HYPOTHESIS: "Mortality on a shark attack is lower when surfing than when doing some other acuatic activity"

## DATA ANALYSIS ##

Once I´ve cleaned the Data Set I ended up with a Data Frame with only two columns: Activity: refering to the activity the victim was doing at the time of the attack: "Surfing" and "Other than surfing" and Fatal (Y/N) refering to the consequence of the attack for the victim, "Y" for a fatal consequence and "N" for some other injury.

With this data I´ve elaborated graphs that show how the chances of getting killed in a shark attack when surfing are much lower than when doing some other acuatic activity.
