# Project2-DATA_CLEANING

## DATA ANALYSIS ##

Once I´ve cleaned the Data Set I ended up with a Data Frame with only two columns: Activity: refering to the activity the victim was doing at the time of the attack: "Surfing" and "Other than surfing" and Fatal (Y/N) refering to the consequence of the attack for the victim, "Y" for a fatal consequence and "N" for some other injury.

With this data I´ve elaborated graphs that show how the chances of getting killed in a shark attack when surfing are much lower than when doing some other acuatic activity.
